## A web application developed in React.Js, to assist in the code review of commits from a repository.

## Resume:

The web application was developed by me and collaborator [augustojwerke](https://github.com/augustowjerke). It is possible to filter the grid records by period, repository and developer. You can view the commit details and also generate a report.
This application has a server, user authentication (login), connection to a database (postgreSQL), and integrates with the github API.
The server was deployed on the website https://squarecloud.app/, and the interface was deployed on the website https://app.netlify.com/.

## functionalities:

+ Filter by:
   + Period
   + Repository
   + Developer
+ View commit details
+ View commit additions/removals (in each committed file)
+ Generate report
+ Dark mode

## How to run the application

1) Access the code-review-back folder and execute the command "npm run start", now the server is running and connected to the database that is hosted for free on the website https://www.elephantsql.com/.
2) Access the code-rewiew-api folder and execute the same command "npm run start", a question regarding the ports will appear in the terminal, you must accept. Okay, now the interface is running, just access localhost and view it.
